# Purpose: This program calculates the total cost of purchasing flooring for a room.
#          It asks the user to enter the length and width of the room and the cost of
#          flooring per square foot. The program then calculates the total square
#          feet needed, the flooring cost, the tax (7%), and the final amount due.


# Resources: Class notes,prior game development knowledge,help from a friend, and the code was written in pycharm

# floor plan  data
length = float(input("Enter the length of the room in feet: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the room in feet: "))
costpersqft = float(input("Enter the cost of flooring per square foot: "))

# Calculations and taxes
totalsqft = length * width
flooringcost = totalsqft * costpersqft
taxes = flooringcost * 0.07
totaldue = flooringcost + taxes

# results displayed
print("\n--- Flooring Cost ---")
print(f"The total area of your room is {totalsqft} square feet.")
print(f"The flooring alone will cost ${flooringcost:.2f}.")
print(f"At a tax rate of 7%, the tax comes to ${taxes:.2f}.")
print(f"That makes your total amount due ${totaldue:.2f}.")
