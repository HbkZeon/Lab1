# Purpose: This program calculates the total cost of purchasing flooring for a room.
#          It asks the user to enter the length and width of the room and the cost of
#          flooring per square foot. The program then calculates the total square
#          feet needed, the flooring cost, the tax (7%), and the final amount due.


# Resources: Class notes,prior game development knowledge,help from a friend, and the code was written in pycharm

# floor plan  data
length = float(input("Enter the length of the room in feet): "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the room in feet): "))
cost_per_sqft = float(input("Enter the cost of flooring per square foot: "))

# Calculations and taxes
total_sqft = length * width
flooring_cost = total_sqft * cost_per_sqft
taxes = flooring_cost * 0.07
total_due = flooring_cost + taxes

# results displayed
print("\n--- Flooring Cost ---")
print(f"The total area of your room is {total_sqft} square feet.")
print(f"The flooring alone will cost ${flooring_cost:.2f}.")
print(f"At a tax rate of 7%, the tax comes to ${taxes:.2f}.")
print(f"That makes your total amount due ${total_due:.2f}.")
